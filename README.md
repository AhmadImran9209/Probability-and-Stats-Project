1. Problem Statement: Ever wondered about the stories hidden in the Titanic data? Our Titanic Data Visualizer App dives into the challenge of making this historical dataset more accessible. We want to make it easy for you to explore and understand who the passengers were, how they differed in age, class, gender, and more, and ultimately, what contributed to their survival.
2. Objective: Our goal here is simple—to create a tool that turns raw Titanic data into engaging visuals. We want you to interact with the data, exploring the highs and lows of the Titanic journey. The app is your guide to discovering the stories behind the numbers and graphs.
3. Data Description: We've taken our data from the 'test.csv' file. Don't worry, if the file is missing, we'll let you know. Before we let you dive in, we've cleaned up the dataset, making sure it's neat and tidy. We've encoded some categories like gender and port of embarkation to make the visualizations shine.
4. Results: This is where it gets exciting! The app brings you a series of snapshots, each capturing a different aspect of the Titanic story:
•	Age Distribution: Explore the ages of passengers with a friendly histogram and smooth curve.
•	Passenger Class Distribution: Get a feel for the social hierarchy onboard with a simple count plot.
•	Gender Distribution: See the balance (or imbalance) between male and female passengers.
•	Embarked Port Distribution: Journey through the ports and find out where most passengers set sail.
•	Fare Distribution: Uncover the range of fares paid by passengers, from budget to luxury.
•	Survival by Class: A gripping plot revealing who made it through based on their ticket class.
